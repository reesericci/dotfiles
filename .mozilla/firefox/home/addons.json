Blocks ads on Facebook, Youtube and all other websites.","fullDescription":"AdGuard ad blocker effectively blocks all types of ads on all web pages, even on Facebook, YouTube, and others!\n\nWhat AdGuard ad blocker does:\n\n1. Blocks all ads: video ads (including YouTube video ads), rich media advertising, unwanted pop-ups, banners and text ads (including Facebook advertisements);\n2. Speeds up page loading and saves bandwidth, thanks to the missing ads and pop up windows;\n3. Blocks many spyware, adware, and dialer installers;\n4. Protects your privacy by blocking common third-party tracking systems;\n5. Protects you from malware and phishing.\n\nHow can AdGuard ad blocker protect your privacy?\n\nJust enable Tracking Protection filter in AdGuard settings. It completely removes all forms of tracking from the Internet. AdGuard has one of the largest tracker filters containing more than 5,000 rules.\n\nHow to remove social media with AdGuard?\n\nTired of all the «Like» buttons and similar widgets infesting all of your frequented web pages? Just enable AdGuard \"Social media filter\" and forget about them.\n\nHow can AdGuard ad blocker protect you from online threats?\n\nAt the moment we’ve got more than 2,000,000 harmful websites on record. AdGuard can block domains known to spread malware, protecting your computer against viruses, Trojan horses, worms, spyware, and adware. AdGuard really lowers the risk of virus infections and prohibits access to harmful websites to prevent potential attacks.\n\nWhy does AdGuard require permissions?\n\n    Access your data for all websites and Access browser tabs: both permissions are necessary for AdGuard to apply all kinds of cosmetic processing to the pages content. Naive ad blocking would simply block ad servers, and leave broken elements and first-party ads on the pages. AdGuard applies special cosmetic rules to make pages look clean and tidy.\n    Access browser activity during navigation: this permission is necessary to keep track of navigation events in order to apply rules when the time is right.\n\n\n==============================\n\nRelease notes:\nhttps://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardBrowserExtension/releases\n\n==============================\n\nFree and Open Source:\nhttps://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardBrowserExtension\n\n==============================\n\nFound a bug?

Facebook from tracking you around the web. The Facebook Container extension for Firefox helps you take control and isolate your web activity from Facebook.","fullDescription":"What does it do?\nFacebook Container works by isolating your Facebook identity into a separate container that makes it harder for Facebook to track your visits to other websites with third-party cookies.\n\nHow does it work?\nInstalling this extension closes your Facebook tabs, deletes your Facebook cookies, and logs you out of Facebook.\nThe next time you navigate to Facebook it will load in a new blue colored browser tab (the “Container”).\nYou can log in and use Facebook normally when in the Facebook Container. If you click on a non-Facebook link or navigate to a non-Facebook website in the URL bar, these pages will load outside of the container.\nClicking Facebook Share buttons on other browser tabs will load them within the Facebook Container. You should know that using these buttons passes information to Facebook about the website that you shared from.\n\nWhich website features will not function?\nBecause you will be logged into Facebook only in the Container, embedded Facebook comments and Like buttons in tabs outside the Facebook Container will not work. This prevents Facebook from associating information about your activity on websites outside of Facebook to your Facebook identity.\n\nIn addition, websites that allow you to create an account or log in using your Facebook credentials will generally not work properly. Because this extension is designed to separate Facebook use from use of other websites, this behavior is expected.\n\nWhat does Facebook Container NOT protect against?\nIt is important to know that this extension doesn’t prevent Facebook from mishandling the data that it already has, or permitted others to obtain, about you. Facebook still will have access to everything that you do while you are on facebook.com, including your Facebook comments, photo uploads, likes, any data you share with Facebook connected apps, etc.\n\nRather than stop using a service you find valuable, we think you should have tools to limit what data others can obtain. This extension focuses on limiting Facebook tracking, but other ad networks may try to correlate your Facebook activities with your regular browsing. In addition to this extension, you can change your Facebook settings, use Private Browsing, enable Tracking Protection, block third-party cookies, and/or use Firefox Multi-Account Containers extension to further limit tracking.\n\nWhat data does Mozilla receive from this extension?\nMozilla does not collect data from your use of the Facebook Container extension. We do receive the number of times the extension is installed or removed. Learn more\n\nOther Containers\nFacebook Container leverages the Containers feature that is already built in to Firefox. When you enable Facebook Container, you may also see Containers named Personal, Work, Shopping, and Banking while you browse. If you wish to use multiple Containers, you’ll have the best user experience if you install the Firefox Multi-Account Containers extension. Learn more about Containers on our support site.\n\nKnown Issues\nWhen Facebook is open and you navigate to another website using the same tab (by entering an address, doing a search, or clicking a bookmark), the new website will be loaded outside of the Container and you will not be able to navigate back to Facebook using the back button in the browser.\n\nNOTE: If you are a Multi-Account Containers user who has already assigned Facebook to a Container, this extension will not work. In an effort to preserve your existing Container set up and logins, this add-on will not include the additional protection to keep other sites out of your Facebook Container. If you would like this additional protection, first unassign facebook.com in the Multi-Account Container extension, and then install this extension.\n\nWhat version of Firefox do I need for this?\nThis extension works with Firefox 57 and higher on Desktop. Note that it does not work on other browsers and it does not work on Firefox for mobile.\n\nIf you believe you are using Firefox 57+, but the install page is telling you that you are not on a supported browser, you can try installing by selecting or copying and pasting this link. (This may be occurring because you have set a preference or installed an extension that causes your browser to obscure its user agent for privacy or other reasons.)\n\nHow does this compare to the Firefox Multi-Account Containers extension?\nFacebook Container specifically isolates Facebook and works automatically. Firefox Multi-Account Containers is a more general extension that allows you to create containers and determine which sites open in each container.\n\nYou can use Multi-Account Containers to create a container for Facebook and assign facebook.com to it. Multi-Account Containers will then make sure to only open facebook.com in the Facebook Container. However, unlike Facebook Container, Multi-Account Containers doesn’t prevent you from opening non-Facebook sites in your Facebook Container. So users of Multi-Account Containers need to take a bit extra care to make sure they leave the Facebook Container when navigating to other sites. In addition, Facebook Container assigns some Facebook-owned sites like Instagram and Messenger to the Facebook Container. With Multi-Account Containers, you will have to assign these in addition to facebook.com.\n\nFacebook Container also deletes Facebook cookies from your other containers on install and when you restart the browser, to clean up any potential Facebook trackers. Multi-Account Containers does not do that for you.\n\nReport Issues\nIf you come across any issues with this extension, please let us know by filing an issue here.

Convert tabs to a list and reduce browser memory","fullDescription":"Whenever you find yourself with too many tabs, click the OneTab icon to convert all of your tabs into a list. When you need to access the tabs again, you can either restore them individually or all at once.\n\nWhen your tabs are in the OneTab list, you will save memory and CPU utilization because you will have reduced the number of tabs open in your browser.\n\nPrivacy assurance\n\nInformation about your tabs are never transmitted or disclosed to either the OneTab developers or any other party. The only exception to this is if you intentionally click on our 'share as a web page' feature that allows you to upload your list of tabs into a web page in order to share them with others. Tabs are never shared unless you specifically use the 'share as a web page' button. We use Google's favicon generator to retrieve favicons for each domain in your list, but only the domain name is used and the full URL is never disclosed.\n\nAdditional Benefits\n\nDepending on how many scripts are running inside your tabs, moving them to OneTab can also speed up your computer by reducing the CPU load. We have also had reports that this also contributes to your computer resuming from sleep more quickly.\n\nFAQ: Why do I need OneTab, when I can just use my browser history?\nA: Your browser history contains every site you've ever visited. OneTab is typically used to store just the smaller selection of open tabs you are not finished with yet - such as when you are mid way through researching a topic.\n\nFAQ: Why do I need OneTab, when I can just use the \"bookmark all tabs\" browser feature?\nA: OneTab is the quickest way, with only one click, to store all of your open tabs into a list. Once they are in your list, OneTab makes it much easier to scan over, delete, label and manage your list of saved tabs. There are also plenty of special options and features, such as the ability to exclude certain web sites, to remove duplicates, and to export/import tabs.","weeklyDownloads":5059,"type":"extension","creator":{"name":"OneTab Team","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/10945418/"},"developers":[],"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/174/174500.png?modified=1543520208","width":700,"height":438,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/174/174500.png?modified=1543520208","thumbnailWidth":640,"thumbnailHeight":400}],"contributionURL":"","averageRating":4.1766,"reviewCount":1003,"reviewURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/onetab/reviews/","updateDate":1564148560000},{"id":"{c63da240-0e1e-4706-b778-e1cecda0e726}","icons":{"32":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/addon_icons/2628/2628187-32.png?modified=e0a5081b","64":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/addon_icons/2628/2628187-64.png?modified=e0a5081b","128":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/addon_icons/2628/2628187-128.png?modified=e0a5081b"},"name":"B!tch to Boss","version":"1.5","sourceURI":"https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/file/3538050/btch_to_boss-1.5-an+fx.xpi?src=","homepageURL":null,"supportURL":null,"description":"Online harassment is a problem.

Easily install custom themes from popular online repositories, or create, edit, and manage your own personalized CSS stylesheets.\n\n\nFeatures\n\n    Versatility of theme installation options. Stylus supports installs from popular online repositories. Additionally, styles can now also be installed from .user.css or .user.styl URLs (see Usercss format documentation in our github wiki).\n    A backup feature for your entire database of installed styles which is compatible with other userstyles managers.\n    An intuitive and configurable automatic update function for installed styles.\n    A highly customizable UI, including theming, optional layouts, icon and badge color choices, along with many other tweaks.\n    Two different optional code validators with user configurable rules.\n\n\nUseful Links\n\n    Source code: https://github.com/openstyles/stylus\n    Video tutorial: https://youtu.be/fCVvGwoF5cQ\n    Chat room: https://discord.gg/tzXVNJz\n    Frequently asked questions: https://github.com/openstyles/stylus/wiki/FAQ\n    Technical bug report: https://github.com/openstyles/stylus/issues\n    General discussion and bug report: https://add0n.com/stylus.html#reviews\n    Localization: https://www.transifex.com/github-7/Stylus/dashboard/\n\n\nPermissions\n\nStylus uses only a small subset of each permission. As you can see in WebExtensions API documentation or simplified tutorials, there's no way to apply any modifications to a web page without gaining the full access permission to that page. Stylus is mostly used to apply global themes, which is why it requests a global permission. In the future we might be able to implement a more granular approach but it's not exactly trivial.\n\n    Access your data for all websites - required for the style elements to be added into the page, not to access any of your data.\n    Access browser tabs - required to show styles in the popup, and for some auxiliary features like regexp tester in the editor.\n    Access browser activity during navigation - required to insert the styles at the exact moment the page is navigated to a different URL.\n    Identity - required for access to cloud services to allow importing and exporting of styles (e.g. Dropbox, etc).\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nUnlike other similar extensions, we don't find you to be all that interesting. Your questionable browsing history should remain between you and the NSA. Stylus collects nothing. Period.\n\n\nFirefox related notes\n\n    To import styles from Stylish add-on please read https://github.com/openstyles/stylus/wiki/FAQ#how-can-i-export-my-user-styles-from-stylish-for-firefox-to-stylus\n    Stylus doesn't apply userstyles to the browser UI or the built-in pages like about:addons because there's no WebExtension API for dynamic application of CSS. You may use another extension that runs an externally installed companion utility to modify userChrome.css and userContent.css and restart Firefox. This restriction is imposed intentionally by Mozilla for security purposes. We don't plan to incorporate the above-mentioned workaround. See https://github.com/openstyles/stylus/wiki/Styling-Firefox-UI\n    Export backups of your database frequently. The main reason we've kept the \"beta\" status for so long is because WebExtension support is still a work in progress for Firefox. Many Firefox specific workarounds have been implemented, but backing up your DB regularly will save you a lot of aggravation should something happen to go wrong.","weeklyDownloads":3931,"type":"extension","creator":{"name":"Stylus Team","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/13438734/"},"developers":[{"name":"Jeremy Schomery","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/11568224/"}],"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/184/184539.png?modified=1543520845","width":700,"height":517,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/184/184539.png?modified=1543520845","thumbnailWidth":640,"thumbnailHeight":473,"caption":"Promo"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/184/184538.png?modified=1543520846","width":700,"height":438,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/184/184538.png?modified=1543520846","thumbnailWidth":640,"thumbnailHeight":400,"caption":"Editor"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/200/200986.png?modified=1543520849","width":843,"height":597,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/200/200986.png?modified=1543520849","thumbnailWidth":640,"thumbnailHeight":453,"caption":"Manager - customizing a usercss style"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/200/200987.png?modified=1543520853","width":970,"height":865,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/200/200987.png?modified=1543520853","thumbnailWidth":538,"thumbnailHeight":480,"caption":"Editor - showing RegExp tester and colorpicker"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/200/200985.png?modified=1543520855","width":538,"height":610,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/200/200985.png?modified=1543520855","thumbnailWidth":423,"thumbnailHeight":480,"caption":"Popup - customizing a usercss style"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/200/200988.png?modified=1543520857","width":576,"height":727,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/200/200988.png?modified=1543520857","thumbnailWidth":380,"thumbnailHeight":480,"caption":"Popup - finding styles"}],"contributionURL":"","averageRating":4.5613,"reviewCount":260,"reviewURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/styl-us/reviews/","updateDate":1587634753000},{"id":"CSSViewer@quantum","icons":{"32":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/addon_icons/980/980085-32.png?modified=d00a9b61","64":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/addon_icons/980/980085-64.png?modified=d00a9b61","128":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/addon_icons/980/980085-128.png?modified=d00a9b61"},"name":"CSSViewer","version":"1.1","sourceURI":"https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/file/983180/cssviewer-1.1-an+fx.xpi?src=","homepageURL":"https://github.com/mohsenkhanpour/CSSViewer","supportURL":"https://github.com/mohsenkhanpour/CSSViewer","description":"A simple yet powerful CSS property viewer.
